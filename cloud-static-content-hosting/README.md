## Intent

Deploy static content to a cloud-based storage service that can deliver them directly to the client. 
This can reduce the need for potentially expensive compute instances.

## Explanation

Real world example

> A global marketing web site with static content needs to be quickly deployed to start attracting
> potential customers. To keep the hosting expenses and maintenance minimum, a cloud hosted storage 
> service along with content delivery network is used.

In plain words

> Static Content Hosting pattern utilizes cloud native storage service to store the content and
> global content delivery network to cache it in multiple data centers around the world.

Wikipedia says

> A static web page (sometimes called a flat page or a stationary page) is a web page that is 
> delivered to the user's web browser exactly as stored, in contrast to dynamic web pages which are 
> generated by a web application.
> 
> Static web pages are suitable for content that never or rarely needs to be updated, though modern 
> web template systems are changing this. Maintaining large numbers of static pages as files can be 
> impractical without automated tools, such as static site generators.
